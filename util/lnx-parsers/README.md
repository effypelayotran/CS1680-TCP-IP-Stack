# lnx file parsers

 This directory contains parsers for the [lnx file
 format](https://brown-csci1680.github.io/iptcp-docs/specs/lnx-files/)
 for the IP project virtual network.  
 
 **Note**:  This directory currently only contains parsers for Go and
 Rust.  We'll release a parser for C/C++ soon!
